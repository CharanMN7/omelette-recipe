## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS

### What I learned

This challenge helped me revise the semantic HTML markup guidelines that I learnt a few months ago. It also made me google around to find ways to customize the bullets of the lists in page. And, I really loved the typography and color choice for the page, done by the Frontend Mentor. I'm slowly learning to cookup my own typography and color choices for good UI/UX.
